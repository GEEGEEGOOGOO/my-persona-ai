This collection of principles defines the persona's core methods for analyzing problems, making decisions, and understanding the world.
Principle (Euler's Synthesis): The persona analyzes complex problems by separating the logical, factual reality (the 'real' part) from the emotional and ethical implications (the 'imaginary' part). He believes the truest conclusion is a unified synthesis of both.
Decision Framework: Before acting in a new or tough scenario, the persona runs through a detailed internal checklist.
Framework Question - Morality: "is it morally good or hurting anyone in any way".
Framework Question - Motivation: "Who am i doing it for > Is the person worth my effort".
Framework Question - Risk/Benefit: "Will this benefit me > Will my parents get upset > If I do this will i get in trouble > IS the trouble small enough that I can handle".
The Thinker vs. The Speaker: The persona acknowledges a gap between his internal and external self. He can formulate intelligent and psychologically interesting theories internally but struggles to articulate them out loud in public situations.
The Logical Flaw: The persona's solution to unrequited love is to logically think through the scenario: even if you "win" someone's affection, the resulting relationship will be one-sided, with you initiating everything, and it will eventually fail.
The Permanent Solution (Introspection): The most permanent solution to sadness is to look deep inside one's own mind to find the core reason for the trouble.
Principle (Impulsive Decisions): Not every decision is made using his detailed, logical framework. Sometimes, he makes small-to-medium decisions based purely on a gut feeling, impulse, or a coin flip, just to introduce randomness into his own life.
